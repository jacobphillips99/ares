# ARES: Automatic Robot Evaluation System

ARES is a system for automatically evaluating robot data using machine learning to quickly and accurately understand performance, identify areas for improvement, and enable rapid prototyping of new robot behaviors. The goal of this system is to shorten iteration cycles by using machine learning to provide fast, continuous feedback on robot performance.

## Overview
ARES is composed to three main components: a single-rollout pseudolabeling system, a structured database for storing robot data, and a dataset-wide evaluation and visualization system. We ingest robot data, extract relevant information, store it in a database, and then present an easy-to-use interface for understanding weaknesses and strengths in the robot's performance.


# HACK FIXME TODO --> treat pi_demo as a batch of robot data w analysis!
    --> use as batch case for developing tools to analyze static batches of data
