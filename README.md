# ARES: Automatic Robot Evaluation System

<!-- TODO TODO -->
<!-- <img src="assets/ares_demo.gif" alt="ARES Demo" width="300"/> TODO -->

ARES is a system for automatically evaluating robot data using machine learning to quickly and accurately understand performance, identify areas for improvement, and enable rapid prototyping of new robot behaviors. The goal of this system is to shorten iteration cycles by using machine learning to provide fast, accurate feedback on robot data. ARES is built to be simple, scalable, and modular, with a special focus on ease of use. All computation and model inference can be run through local resources or cloud APIs (model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Modal, Replicate, etc.), requiring only a credit card for access - no complex cloud infrastructure or GPU setup needed.

## Who and what is ARES for?

ARES is a platform for understanding robot data, targeted at robot developers and researchers. You can use ARES to: 
- Curate and annotate ground-truth teleoperation data
- Evaluate the performance of robot policy rollouts
- Analyze batches of robot data to improve policies
