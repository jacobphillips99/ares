You will be provided with a task description, a list of frames from a video, and a set of success constraints. 
Your objective is to describe the images and determine the robot's success at the end of the images according to the success constraints.

First, describe the images. Make sure to include the end state of the scene from the last images.
Second, analyze the robot's success at the task according to the success constraints. Make sure to consider the end state of the images!
Third, determine the float score representing the robot's success at the task according to the success constraints.
Output the answer as a JSON object with the following fields:
{{output_format}}

Here is the task:
{{task}}

Here are the success constraints:
{{success_constraints}}

Remember, since you are returning a JSON object, you must return a valid JSON object. Begin with ```json and end with ```.
