The task is to watch the following video and list the important objects in the video which will be used to query bounding boxes.
The video will be about a robot performing a task. Pay special attention to the robot and the objects it interacts with. 
Use general purpose nouns for objects, such as "a cup" or "a bowl"; however, don't overgeneralize to the point that the object is not specific, such as "a object".
Do not provide background information like "table" or "surface" or "floor"; focus on the objects that are important to the task.
Do not just say "a red object"; always use the actual name of the object.
The output format is a simple period-separated list of simple descriptions of objects, such as "a cup. a bowl. a robot."

For example, imagine a video of a robot picking up a square red cup and pouring it into a round blue bowl. The important objects are the robot, the cup, and the bowl.
The output should be "a cup. a bowl. a robot."

Watch the following video and list the important objects in the video:
